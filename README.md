 ## Introduction

The purpose of this repo is to aid in the processes of revamping your public image by deleting your cringe or unwanted posts/reposts from your twitter/X account from a given period.

## Prerequisites

- **Twitter Developer Account**: You must have access to the Twitter API, which requires a Twitter developer account. You can apply for one at the Twitter Developer Platform.

- **API Keys**: After creating an app in the developer portal, youâ€™ll need:
  	- API Key
  	- API Key Secret
  	- Access Token
	- Access Token Secret

- *Notes*: I will be using VS code with python 3.9.6. It is recommended that you set up a virtual environment as good practice.
